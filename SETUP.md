# AI Chat Assistant Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Database Connection**: Working with Neon PostgreSQL  
✅ **Backend API**: Fully functional with conversation storage  
⚠️ **AI Provider**: Currently using test mode (see setup below)  

## Quick Test
Your application is now running! You can:
1. Click the preview button to open the interface
2. Try sending a message - it will work with a test response
3. Messages are being saved to your Neon database
4. All UI features (settings, history, etc.) are working

## To Enable Real AI Responses

### Option 1: Use OpenAI (Recommended)
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Replace this line in your `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```
   with your actual API key.

3. Update the chat endpoint:
   - Change `/api/test-chat` back to `/api/chat` in `EnhancedChatInterface.tsx` line 114

### Option 2: Continue with Z.ai
If you prefer to stick with Z.ai, the configuration should work but may require:
1. Checking if your Z.ai API key is valid
2. Verifying Z.ai service availability
3. The Z.ai package might need updates

## Database Features Working
- ✅ Conversation creation and storage
- ✅ Message history persistence  
- ✅ User conversations with proper relationships
- ✅ Archive, pin, and delete functionality ready
- ✅ Full CRUD operations via API endpoints

## API Endpoints Available
- `POST /api/test-chat` - Test chat with database (currently active)
- `POST /api/chat` - Real AI chat with OpenAI
- `GET /api/conversations` - List all conversations  
- `POST /api/conversations` - Create new conversation
- `GET /api/conversations/[id]` - Get specific conversation
- `PUT /api/conversations/[id]` - Update conversation (title, pin, archive)
- `DELETE /api/conversations/[id]` - Delete conversation

## What's Working Right Now
1. **Full UI**: All components, settings, dialogs working
2. **Database Integration**: Complete with Neon PostgreSQL
3. **File Operations**: Upload, download, share functionality
4. **Theme System**: Light/dark/system themes
5. **Conversation Management**: Create, edit, pin, archive, delete
6. **Input Controls**: File upload, research tools, voice (UI ready)

## Next Steps
1. Add your OpenAI API key to enable real AI responses
2. Test all conversation features
3. Optionally implement user authentication
4. Add more AI providers if needed

The application is fully functional - just needs an AI API key for real responses!
