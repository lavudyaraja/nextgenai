# OpenAI API Fix Documentation

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**
Your deployment was failing with the error:
```
GPT service error: Failed to get response from GPT: 404 The model `gpt-4` does not exist or you do not have access to it.
```

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Updated GPT Service with Model Fallback System**
- **File**: `src/services/gptService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added automatic fallback between multiple GPT models
  - Models tried in order: `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`
  - Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
  - Better API key validation

### 2. **Created Environment Health Check**
- **File**: `src/app/api/health/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Diagnose environment variable and API connectivity issues
- **Usage**: Visit `/api/health` to check your deployment status

### 3. **Added OpenAI Model Testing Script**
- **File**: `scripts/test-openai-models.ts`
- **Purpose**: Test which OpenAI models are available with your API key
- **Usage**: Run `npm run test:openai` locally to test models

## 🚀 **How to Deploy and Fix**

### **Step 1: Redeploy with Updated Code**
```bash
# The fixes are now in your codebase
git add .
git commit -m "Fix OpenAI API model compatibility"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Check Your Vercel Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your actual OpenAI API key
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your database connection string
- Any other AI provider keys you want to use

### **Step 3: Test the Health Check**
After deployment, visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`

This will show you:
- ✅ Which environment variables are configured
- ✅ Whether OpenAI API is working
- ❌ Any specific errors

### **Step 4: Test Locally (Optional)**
```bash
# Test OpenAI models availability
npm run test:openai

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was likely one of these:

1. **Model Deprecation**: OpenAI frequently updates available models
2. **API Key Permissions**: Your API key might not have access to certain models
3. **Account Tier**: Some models require paid accounts
4. **Regional Availability**: Some models aren't available in all regions

## 🛡️ **Prevention Measures Applied**

1. **Fallback System**: If one model fails, the system automatically tries others
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear indication of what went wrong
3. **Health Monitoring**: Easy way to check system status
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation instead of crashes

## 📊 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

- ✅ GPT service will work with available models
- ✅ Automatic fallback if primary model fails
- ✅ Clear error messages for configuration issues
- ✅ Health check endpoint for monitoring

## 🔧 **Next Steps if Still Not Working**

1. **Check Health Endpoint**: Visit `/api/health` after deployment
2. **Verify API Key**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
3. **Check Model Access**: Some models require special access or higher tier accounts
4. **Try Alternative Providers**: The app supports Gemini, Claude, and other providers

The fix implements a robust fallback system that should resolve the model availability issue while providing better diagnostics for future troubleshooting.
